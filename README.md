# Marvin

Serving as my thesis project, Marvin excels in autonomous navigation, skillfully maneuvering through complex pathways while avoiding obstacles with the prowess of its integrated LIDAR sensor. 
Guided by the RRT algorithm, Marvin dynamically generates paths, rapidly adapting to its environment and showcasing the seamless fusion of robotics and computer science in modern technology.
